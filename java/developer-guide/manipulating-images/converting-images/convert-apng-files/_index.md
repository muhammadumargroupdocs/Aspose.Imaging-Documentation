# **Overview**
The Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) file format is an extension to the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) specification. It allows for animated PNG files that work similarly to animated GIF files, while supporting 24-bit images and 8-bit transparency not available for GIFs. It also retains backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files.

Now the APNG file format is available in the Aspose.Imaging.
It is implemented in the "com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.apng.ApngImage" class. In general, the behavior of this class is the same as that of similar animated formats (like Gif or Webp).
