To process images, Aspose.Imaging for SharePoint relies on a built-in version of [Aspose.Imaging for .NET](http://www.aspose.com/.net/imaging-component.aspx). 

{{% /alert %}} 

With Aspose.Imaging for SharePoint installed you can export an image to other supported image formats, resize, rotate and flip without using any image editor.

| :- | :- |
