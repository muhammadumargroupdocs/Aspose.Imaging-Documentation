You can download an evaluation version of Aspose.Imaging for SharePoint from the [download page](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/73/sharepoint-components/aspose-imaging-for-sharepoint/default.aspx). The evaluation version provides the same features as the fully licensed version of the component with a couple of restrictions. When you buy Aspose.Imaging, simply applying the license removes any restrictions from the installed evaluation.

The evaluation version of Aspose.Imaging for SharePoint provides full product functionality, with only one limitation:

- **A watermark on each image**: Any image you save, modify or export has a watermark reading "Evaluation Only. Created with Aspose.Imaging. Copyright Aspose Pty Ltd.".

**Aspose.Imaging for SharePoint injects an evaluation warning when working in the evaluation mode**

If you want to test Aspose.Imaging for SharePoint without the evaluation limitations, request a 30-day temporary license. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](http://www.aspose.com/purchase/templicense.aspx) for more information.
