Canvas is an element in HTML5 which can be used for dynamic rendering of 2D graphics. It allows to draw pathes, boxes, texts,
images and many other things. For instance, Canvas can be // // used to draw graphs, combine photos, or create simple (or complex) diagrams.

The Canvas element is not supported in some older browsers, but is supported in recent versions of all major browsers.
