### **Deskew image**
**Skew** is an artifact that might appear during document scanning process and it consists of getting the document’s text/images be rotated at a slight angle.
It can have various causes but the most common are paper getting misplaced during a scan.
Therefore, **deskew** is the process of detecting and fixing this issue on scanned files (ie, bitmap) so deskewed images will have the text/images correctly and horizontally aligned.
