Aspose.Imaging for .NET supports drawing **Raster**(JPEG, GIF, TIFF, BMP) images to **Vector**(SVG, EMF, WMF) images. **Raster** images are based on pixels and thus lose clarity when scaled, while **Vector** based images can be scaled indefinitely without degrading quality.

## **Draw Raster Image on SVG**
Using Aspose.Imaging for .NET you can draw raster image on SVG. With a few simple steps, you will be able to draw an existing raster image on a vector file.

- Load a raster image using the factory method Load exposed by Image class.
- Load a SVG image
- Draw a rectangular part of the raster image within the specified bounds of the vector image
- Save the results
